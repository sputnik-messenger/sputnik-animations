# sputnik-animations


Animations, used in Sptunik Messenger.

Note that some animations may represent with their colors, shapes and text the trademark of Sputnik Messenger.

When using those animations, you have to change the code in a way that resulting animations don't have any resemblance with the ui / logo / trademark of Sputnik Messenger.
